Voice-to-SVG UI Architect

An AI-powered design engine that converts natural language requirements into mathematically precise, scalable SVG code in real-time.

 **How it Works**

1. **User Input:** The user speaks or types a UI requirement (e.g., "A neon-blue loading bar").
2. **Logic Layer:** The Golden Prompt instructs the LLM to process this into SVG paths and attributes.
3. **Instant Rendering:** The app captures the code and renders it live in the browser.
